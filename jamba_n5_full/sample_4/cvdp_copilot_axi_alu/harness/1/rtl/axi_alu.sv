Provide one answer for this request: The given `axi_alu` module is designed to implement a configurable arithmetic/logic processing unit that can be dynamically controlled by a host via an AXI4 interface. The design integrates an AXI4-based control interface with a digitalsignal processing (DSP) engine, a memory block, and clock-domain management with Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) synchronization. However, during testing, it was observed that the module is not functioning as expected as given in the `Actual Behavior` section below.

### Actual Behavior:
1. **CDC Logic:**
   - The CDC synchronizers in the given RTL are not correctly gated by the `clock_control` signal. This is leading to incorrect data synchronization when switching between clock domains, leading to potential metastability issues.

2. **AXI Interface:**
   - The AXI write and read logic in the `axi_csr_block` do not correctly handle burst transactions, leading to incorrect address updates and data transfers when AXI Burst transactions are used to initialize RAM memory. 
   - Specifically, INCR burst Write transaction Fails as Write address is stuck at start Address.

3. **Memory Block:**
   - The memory block in the given RTL does not correctly handle the RAM Control and data signals, leading to incorrect writes to the memory array.
   - The `result_address` is not correctly updated, causing incorrect result storage in CSR register

4. **DSP Block:**
   - The DSP block does not correctly pass the result value to CSR, leading to incorrect computation of results when AXI reads result register from CSR Block.
   - DSP result output is not stored in the CSR register.


### Expected Behavior:
1. **Clock Domain Crossing (CDC):**
   - When `clock_control` is HIGH, the design should operate on the `fast_clk_in` domain, and CDC synchronizers should be used to safely transfer data between the `axi_clk_in` and `fast_clk_in` domains. 
      - In this case, The CSR register output signals (`operand_a_addr`, `operand_b_addr`, `operand_c_addr`, `op_select`, `start`)  that are used by DSP block need to be synchronized with double flop synchronizer.
      - CSR input signal (`dsp_result`) from DSP block also need to be synchronized with double flop synchronizer.
   - When `clock_control` is LOW, the design should operate on the `axi_clk_in` domain, and no CDC synchronization should be applied.

2. **AXI Interface:**
   - The AXI interface should correctly handle write and read transactions, including burst transfers, and update the CSR registers accordingly.
   - Burst Transfer signals (`axi_awlen_i`, `axi_awsize_i`, `axi_awburst_i`, `axi_wlast_i`, `axi_rlast_o`) and related response signals (`axi_rresp_o`, `axi_bresp_o`) should be added.

|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `0x00`             | `operand_a_addr`        | 32-bit    | Holds the address for operand A in the memory block.                            | Read/Write |
| `0x04`             | `operand_b_addr`        | 32-bit    | Holds the address for operand B in the memory block.                            | Read/Write |
| `0x08`             | `operand_c_addr`        | 32-bit    | Holds the address for operand C in the memory block.                            | Read/Write |
| `0x0C`             | `op_select`             | 2-bit     | Selects the operation to be performed by the DSP block[1:0]                     | Read/Write |
| `0x0C`             | `start`                 | 1-bit     | Starts the DSP operation when set to `1`[2].                                    | Read/Write |
| `0x10`             | `clock_control`         | 1-bit     | Controls the clock selection:<br> - `0`: AXI clock<br> - `1`: Fast clock        | Read/Write |
| `0x14` to `0x1C`   | Reserved                | -         | Reserved for future use.                                                        | -          |
| `0x20` to `0x5C`   | Memory Data Registers   | 32-bit    | Stores data in the memory block. Each address corresponds to a memory location. | Read/Write |
| `result_address`   | `result_address`        | 32-bit    | Outputs the value stored in the first memory location (`ram[0]`).               | Read-Only  |


3. **Memory Block:**
   - The memory block should implement a RAM (16 locations, 32-bit each) that allows synchronous writes and asynchronous reads, with the ability to store and retrieve data based on the provided addresses from above given CSR registers.
    - **Memory Initialization**:
      - On reset (`reset_in` is high), all 16 memory locations are initialized to `0`.
      - The `result_address` output used to store DSP block result is also reset to `0`.
    - **Synchronous Write Operation**:
      - Writes are performed on the rising edge of `axi_clk`.
      - When `we` is high, the `write_data` is written into the memory location specified by `write_address`.
      - The value of `ram[0]` is also copied to the `result_address` output during initial memory Initialization phase.
    - **Asynchronous Read Operation**:
      - Reads are performed on the rising edge of `ctrld_clk` (can be AXI clock or Fast clock).
      - The data from the memory locations specified by `address_a`, `address_b`, and `address_c` are read and assigned to `data_a`, `data_b`, and `data_c`, respectively and send to DSP block.
      - If `reset_in` is high, the outputs `data_a`, `data_b`, and `data_c` are reset to `0`.

4. **DSP Block:**
   - The DSP block should perform the selected arithmetic operation (based on `op_select`) when the `start` signal is asserted, and the result should be available in the `result` output which is passed to CSR block.

We need to find and fix the bugs.

The main issues are likely in CDC synchronization, AXI burst handling, memory initialization, and possibly some timing or data transfer.

Let's go through each part.

1. **CDC Logic:**
   - The CDC synchronizers are present but not properly connected. The code has separate CDC synchronizers for each clock domain. But they might be incorrectly used. The issue: the code uses `assign operand_a = ...` with CDC synchronizer but maybe the timing is wrong. Also, the `clock_control` is used to switch between fast and slow clock. The CDC logic should be synchronized when `clock_control` is active. The code currently has CDC blocks inside the clock domain. That seems fine, but maybe the assignment is not using proper CDC logic for all signals. Also, the `clock_control` is used to select which domain to use. The code uses `assign operand_a = (clock_control) ? operand_a_sync : operand_a_cdc;`. But the `operand_a_sync` and `operand_a_cdc` are not defined. They might be missing.

We need to add CDC synchronizers for all signals. The current code has CDC blocks for `operand_a`, `operand_b`, `operand_c`, `op_select`, `start`. But we need to ensure that each of these is wrapped in CDC synchronizer when the clock changes. The current code has a single CDC block for each. That might be okay. But the issue might be that the CDC is not used for all signals.

But the user says: "CDC Logic: The CDC synchronizers in the given RTL are not correctly gated by the `clock_control` signal." So we need to ensure that CDC blocks are enabled when `clock_control` is high. In the code, the CDC blocks are already conditionally assigned based on `clock_control`. So that seems correct. But we might need to ensure that the synchronizer is used for all signals.

2. **AXI Interface:**
   - The AXI write and read logic in the `axi_csr_block` do not correctly handle burst transactions, leading to incorrect address updates and data transfers when AXI Burst transactions are used to initialize RAM memory. Specifically, INCR burst Write transaction Fails as Write address is stuck at start Address.

We need to modify the `axi_csr_block` to support burst writes. The current `axi_csr_block` has a single `axi_awaddr_i` for write address, but burst write would require multiple writes to the same address. The code should handle multiple writes by detecting repeated addresses or incrementing addresses. However, the current code doesn't support burst. So we need to add logic to detect bursts.

But the requirement: "Specifically, INCR burst Write transaction Fails as Write address is stuck at start Address." This indicates that the current logic does not support burst writes, and the address remains at start. So we need to implement a way to track the last address used and increment.

We can modify the `axi_csr_block` to have a variable `current_address` that increments on each write. But the module is small. We can add a state machine.

3. **Memory Block:**
   - The memory block does not correctly handle RAM Control and data signals, leading to incorrect writes. The `result_address` is not correctly updated, causing incorrect result storage.

We need to add a way to store the result in the memory block. The memory block has 16 locations. The `result_address` should be used to write the result to memory. But currently, the memory block writes to `data_a`, `data_b`, etc. We need to use the `result_address` to write the result.

Also, the memory block should handle synchronous writes on the rising edge of `axi_clk`. The current code uses `always @(posedge axi_clk)` but that might not be enough. We
